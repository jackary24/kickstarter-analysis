# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**
---
## **Project Overview**
During this module we were tasked with analyzing data from Kickstarter campaigns in order to help our client Louise,
make informed decisions about the start of her own Project.Louise’s desired Kickstarter was for a play she was looking to crowdfund, 
and as a result our analysis was performed on only data relevant to theaters and plays. By the end of our work we were able to 
present her with multiple visuals and compiled data in order to make the appropriate recommendations on where she should set her 
goals and expectations.

## **Analysis & Challenges**
To start the analysis during the module we worked on formatting the data, as well as different methods of filtering, in order to
separate what was pertinent, and what was not, to our project. From there We explored how to visualize some of the relevant data, as 
well as how to drill down deeper into it with Pivot Charts and Graphs to better refine the analysis to match Louise’s inquiries. We 
also used descriptive statistics, as well as a box and whisker plot, to identify how the data was distributed,and to look at how 
successful Kickstarters were planned and executed.
