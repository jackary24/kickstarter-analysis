# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**
---
## **Project Overview**
During this module we were tasked with analyzing data from Kickstarter campaigns in order to help our client Louise,
make informed decisions about the start of her own Project.Louise’s desired Kickstarter was for a play she was looking to crowdfund, 
and as a result our analysis was performed on only data relevant to theaters and plays. By the end of our work we were able to 
present her with multiple visuals and compiled data in order to make the appropriate recommendations on where she should set her 
goals and expectations.

## **Analysis & Challenges**
  To start the analysis during the module we worked on formatting the data, as well as different methods of filtering, in order to
separate what was pertinent, and what was not, to our project. From there We explored how to visualize some of the relevant data, as 
well as how to drill down deeper into it with Pivot Charts and Graphs to better refine the analysis to match Louise’s inquiries. We 
also used descriptive statistics, as well as a box and whisker plot, to identify how the data was distributed,and to look at how 
successful Kickstarters were planned and executed.

### Box & Whisker Plot

 _The module culminated in the creation of two graphics, one based on launch date and the other based on goals of the campaign, in order to make recommendations through this written analysis.

### Outcomes Based on Category & Sub-Category

  Having spent a lot of my day in Excel during work, I was surprised to learn a few new things, and was challenged with a few new functions that I have found myself utilizing in my day today. I was by no means an expert going in, and ran into some challenges with the COUNTIF function taking in multiple criteria, With the help of both the link sent in the class discussion (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countifs-function-dda3dc6e-f74e-4aee-88bc-aa8c2a866842?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) , as well as some input from Adai Urieta in our #virtual_study_squad group, I was able to figure it out. Once I am more comfortable with it I will not even feel the need to double check my figures with filters.

## **Results**

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  On the first visual we prepared for Louise we looked at the results of Kickstarters based on their launch date. From the above graph we can draw two conclusions. The first recommendation I would make to her would be to launch her campaign in the late Spring or early summer, with the most successful theater campaigns being launched in May. On the other hand, the second recommendation we can make to Louise is that she should avoid mid-Fall, as October has the highest rate of failure of any month. The rate at which projects are cancelled remains relatively constant, and I would not place much attention on the dates of those canceled.

### Outcomes vs Goals

  On the second visual compiled for Louise, we looked at the percentage of campaigns that succeeded and failed based on the amount those campaigns were seeking to raise. We broke the campaigns down into 12 ranges and grouped them accordingly. The majority of successful Kickstarter campaigns in the Play subcategory were found to have a lower goal, no more than $14999, although there was a second boom in the $35,000 to $44,999 dollar range. Since we are looking at percentages in the graph I also took into account the actual data behind our figures and would recommend Louise aim for the first range, as there were 661 successful Kickstarters between $0-$14,999 as opposed to 6 successful campaigns in the $35,000 to $49,999 range. A word of caution to Louise however, as she grows closer to the $14,999 amount her chances of a successful campaign fall by about 20 percent, so the lower the better!

## **Limitations & Further Research**

  One of the largest limitations I saw in this data is its age. Some of the records go as far back as 2010, with the most recent end date being from 2017. It is possible that patterns of backers and projects have changed in the past four years, as well as the public’s appetite for live theater. I would feel more comfortable making these recommendations to Louise with more recent data, and would encourage her to include some other sites that have sprung up since the success of the Kickstarter campaign. Does one specific site have a higher rate of successful Theater Campaigns? How would a play fair in today’s environment? Are backers more or less likely to donate in 2021 than they were in 2017? These questions can be answered with more recent data and further research into the crowdfunding environment, but at this time I would ask Louise to take my recommendations with a grain of salt, as I am not sure accurate conclusions can be drawn from the data we currently have. 

I would recommend three further graphs to explore the characteristics of a successful campaign. I would be curious to look at the overall number of backers, in order to decide if it would be to Louise’s benefit to target multiple, smaller donors, or try to hook one large  patron to fund the majority of her goal. To do this I would break the number of backers for successful campaigns into ranges, or bins, similar to what was done with the Outcomes Based on Goals graphic, to see if we could identify any patterns. I would also be interested in looking at the difference between the start and end date of campaigns in order to help determine what length of campaign is the most successful. Lastly I would like to find a way to group plays based on subject matter in order to see what kinds of plays the public is most interested in. Would it be worth Louise’s time to sink money into a romance play when the public is more interested in Sci-Fi. The more we are able to classify and define more successful campaigns, the better we are able to make accurate recommendations for Louise.
