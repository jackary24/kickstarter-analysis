# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**
---
## **Project Overview**
During this module we were tasked with analyzing data from Kickstarter campaigns in order to help our client Louise,
make informed decisions about the start of her own Project.Louiseâ€™s desired Kickstarter was for a play she was looking to crowdfund, 
and as a result our analysis was performed on only data relevant to theaters and plays. By the end of our work we were able to 
present her with multiple visuals and compiled data in order to make the appropriate recommendations on where she should set her 
goals and expectations.
